# Reflection

Regarding the estimates, the accuracy is surprisingly on point for the first few practicals that I estimated but then
the level of precision went down a bit for a few more practicals, and then it went back up. From doing estimates,
I learned that overestimating is better than under. Because whenever I estimate, my subconsciousness is trying to make
me finish my work before the estimated time. So if I put my time estimate short, I do quickly and makes mistakes and 
eventually passing the estimated time. However, if I put my time estimate longer, I do slowly and take my time.
Resulting in fewer mistakes and steadily finish the work.

From doing code reviews, as reviewer, I learned that I don't actually know what to look for other than naming 
conventions and such. As a reviewee, I learned that I'm a messy coder. While it looks organised in my point of
view, it is not for others.

Regarding the practical tasks overall, I would like to add the solutions to these practicals, or similar codes to
reference to when working on the practical. 

# Code Reviews

I point out what the reviwee missed and gave an overall review.

I point out variable naming in classes and how it is used in the main code with examples.
